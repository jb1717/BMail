# BMail
This project was made for a hackathon. Alternative webclient for mailing made with angular.js and node.js

###Â How to use it
First, start by configuring your mail server by opening the file .config.json at the root of the project.
The server is now ready.
Then, open the file angular/public/js/app.js and change the value of ipApi at line 6. You have to set your mail server IP. By default the server listens on localhost:3000.
 Finally, you can't read your mail in your favorite browser by accessing it at the address: http://localhost:8080. You can change the listening address by editing the Mailissa script.
